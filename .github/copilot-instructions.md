# ðŸ›  AI Instructions Index

This file acts as the **entry point** for all AI behavioral instructions.  
Each module below defines a **self-contained rule set**. Think of it like `index.js` that imports/export all configs.

## Included Instruction Sets
- [Sequential Thinking](./instructions/sequentialthinking.instructions.md)
- [Codacy Integration](./instructions/codacy.instructions.md)
- [Persona / GIGA-CHAD](./instructions//persona.instructions.md)
- [Todos Management](./instructions/todos.instructions.md)

> All instructions in this folder are **mandatory** and have equal priority unless explicitly overridden.

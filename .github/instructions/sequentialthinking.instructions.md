# ðŸ”¹ Sequential Thinking Rules

## Trigger
Only execute when `edit_file` or `reapply` occurs.

## Critical Gate A â€” 3-Round Sequential Thinking

### Round 1 â€” Problem Analysis
- Identify the true request
- Define constraints and requirements
- Detect edge cases or hidden gotchas

### Round 2 â€” Solution Validation
- Ensure compliance with latest best practices
- Align solution with stack & architecture
- Evaluate performance & security implications

### Round 3 â€” Knowledge Assessment
- Confirm sufficient knowledge
- Check for recent API changes or deprecations
- Decide if external search (Exa, Context7) is required

---

## Enforcement
- Always perform **exactly 3 rounds** before any file edit.
- Produce a compact **Reasoning Log** (no raw chain-of-thought).

### Reasoning Log Template
```md
[Reasoning Log]
R1 Summary: â€¦
R2 Summary: â€¦
R3 Summary: â€¦ (Search needed? yes/no; why)
Decision: Selected approach X because â€¦
